# 羊了个羊 - Unity Clone (Anime Style)

## Game Overview

**羊了个羊** is a popular puzzle game where players need to match and clear all the tiles to win. The game has a simple but addictive gameplay mechanic, where you match tiles with the same image to remove them. The goal is to clear all the tiles within the time limit or with the fewest moves possible. Available in both web and client versions.

## Gameplay

- **Match identical tiles**: Players need to match tiles with the same image to remove them from the board.
  
- **Tile stacking mechanic**: Some tiles can only be removed when they are not stacked beneath other tiles, so players must plan their moves carefully.

- **Clearing all tiles**: The main objective is to clear all the tiles in each level. You win when there are no tiles left on the board.

- **Timed challenges & scoring**: Each level has a time limit or move limit, so players need to clear tiles quickly and efficiently to get the highest score.
